# Intro to GRASS GIS processing (Vanderbilt 2024)

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for workshop for Vanderbilt university.

## How to run the notebooks
The workshop can be run online in [WholeTale](https://wholetale.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This is a convenient way, since no installation is needed.

#### WholeTale
WholeTale is a scalable, open source, web-based platform for reproducible research.

1. Go to https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/65d653d5e15e7a4ab5292290
2. Log in (there are different options)
3. Run Tale (blue button at the top right)
4. Confirm Copy and Run Tale
5. If it keeps showing Importing... try to reload
6. Run Tale

#### Google Colab

In Colab:
1. Download [prepared notebook](https://github.com/ncsu-geoforall-lab/grass-gis-workshop-vanderbilt-2024/blob/main/colab_notebook.ipynb)
2. Open [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. File -> Upload notebook
4. Upload downloaded notebook

In Google Colab we don't have pre-installed the software needed, so go ahead and execute the first cell to install it. Also, in order to avoid repeating the installation, we merged all notebooks into one.
